# Paint Application

A paint application, often simply referred to as "paint software" or "paint program," is computer software designed for creating free style painting.
## Documentation

Before jumping to the code here are a few of the methods which we will be using in building our app:

void setStrokeJoin (Paint.Join join) : This method sets the paint to join to either ROUND, PAINT , PATH

setAntiAlias (boolean aa) : AntiAliasing smooths out the edges of what is drawn but has little effect on the shape’s interior.

setDither(boolean dither) : Dithering affects the down-sampling of colors that are of higher precision than the device’s accuracy.




## Features

Paint applications, also known as graphic design or drawing software, come with a variety of features to help users create, edit, and manipulate digital images and artwork. The specific features can vary between different applications, but here are some common features you'll find in many paint applications:

Brushes and Drawing Tools: Paint applications offer a variety of brushes, pens, pencils, and other drawing tools for creating lines, shapes, and textures. Users can often customize the size, opacity, and hardness of brushes.

Undo and Redo: These functions allow users to correct mistakes or backtrack through their editing history, ensuring greater flexibility and control.

Pen and Tablet Support: Some paint applications are optimized for use with graphics tablets and stylus pens, offering pressure sensitivity and other features for more natural drawing and painting.

Custom Brushes and Patterns: Users can often create and save their custom brushes, patterns, and textures for use in their artwork.

Guides and Grids: Paint applications may provide tools for creating guides, grids, and rulers to assist in precise drawing and alignment.

Cloning and Healing Tools: These tools help to remove imperfections in photos or duplicate parts of an image.
